## The Team!

## The problem

* :nerd_face: MATLAB is really popular with researchers
* :technologist: Not so much with RSEs
* :confounded: There is limited guidance on good practice
* :mechanic: So lots of MATLAB-based research could be more reproducible & sustainable

## The solution

:book: Guidance for researchers via a handbook/course.

:tada: Enter: **repliMAT**!

:recycle: A guide for reproducible MATLAB projects

## Hack day! 

### Templates for MATLAB project organisation!



## Project Organisation

Encouraging good practice via project organisation

e.g.

+ Keep raw data separate from processed data and only change programatically,
+ Documentation
+ Tests
+ Readme
+ Licenses
